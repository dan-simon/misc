Notation reviews, with final scores in the format (serious, joke)/10:

Scientific: Solid choice. Very easy to do arithmetic operations such as adding compared to anything else. Terrible as a joke notation due to being good as a serious notation. (10, 0)/10

Engineering: The exponent is forced to be a multiple of three, so in some sense this is base 1000, but at the same time the base and exponent are both given in base 10, and the exponent is the base 10 exponent. When I was first writing this description I found this annoying, but now it seems not too bad. This notation isn't actually any worse than scientific for number manipulation. As before, good enough as a serious notation to be terrible as a joke notation. (10, 0)/10

Letters: Engineering, but the exponent is given with letters. Good for addition, which is the main operation you need. When you do want to do multiplication, one of the factors, if not both, is generally small, and letters is good for that too. Aesthetically arguably better than Engineering. Hard to convert to scientific, but this is only an issue when you want to know something in scientific or want to get help. OK joke notation because you can spell out words, but not great. (8, 4)/10

Standard: OK up to infinity. After that it gets unwieldy in length and harder to convert to scientific. Has tons of arbitrary prefixes. Can be used as a joke notation in a pinch if the numbers are high enough, and in fact is often considered in that way. (7, 3)/10.

Cancer: Except that you have to memorize which emoji corresponds to which letter, basically the same as Letters, except if you explain you're using it seriously everyone will think you're joking. It's the first joke notation, but only a good joke notation at all because using emoji in a notation is weird and because of the tradition of it being a joke notation. That counts for a lot, though. (7, 7)/10

Mixed scientific: Like scientific except standard under 1e33. Standard under 1e33 is easy to remember and deal with, arguably easier than scientific under a quadrillion or so, so this isn't a minus. Also not a good joke notation due to being a good serious notation. (10, 0)/10

Mixed engineering: Like engineering except standard under 1e33. Insert second and third sentences of "Mixed scientific" description here. (10, 0)/10

Logarithm: Doing addition is harder than with scientific. Doing multiplication is as easy or easier than with scientific, but I think you need to do addition more than multiplication. It's not too hard to convert to scientific, and trivial to convert to scientific within an order of magnitude. Good enough as a serious notation to be terrible as a joke notation. (9, 0)/10

Brackets: Logarithm except it's base 6 and the brackets are in a confusing order. The being base 6 means it's far harder to convert to scientific with any reasonable accuracy. Also, you have to remember the order of the brackets, and unlike with Cancer there's no mnemonic (though there are only 6 of them). Also also, brackets are far easier to confuse with each other than numbers, letters, or emoji. OK as a joke notation because it looks a lot like a bunch of meaningless brackets to those who don't know how it works, but not great because it looks like logarithm and then actually is like logarithm. (6, 6)/10

Infinity: Logarithm but with the log being the log base infinity, though still expressed in base 10. This is not too hard to roughly convert to scientific, but it's harder to do so than with logarithm. As with Logarithm, addition is hard and multiplication isn't. Not a great joke notation because it makes too much sense. I think it might have been intended as a joke notation though so it has that going for it. (8, 2)/10

Roman: Unwieldy in length for numbers above a few million, nontrivial even to compare numbers, not too bad to add numbers if there isn't some display issue stopping you from seeing what the numbers fully are, uses base four million which makes it comparatively hard to convert to scientific even roughly and very hard to convert to scientific exactly. A good joke notation because of all these things, plus roman numerals on a computer (or anywhere but a carving or book, honestly) are sort of weird. (5, 8)/10

Dots: It's hard to learn how this works without looking at the source, but once you know how it works, it's basically base 254 logarithm notation. It has more precision than any other notation, with some small exceptions. You have to memorize less than with Brackets (just in what order to take the dots), but you do have to convert binary to decimal for small numbers to read individual digits. Roughly converting to scientific isn't impossible but it involves more individual steps than for other notations for which it's possible. A great joke notation because if you don't know how it works, it looks like complete nonsense. (6, 10)/10

Zalgo: The zalgo text is basically impossible to interpret, but if you just ignore the zalgo text, it's logarithm but with the log being the log base e66.666, though still expressed in base 10. Not too hard to convert to scientific, addition is hard, multiplication isn't, without reading the zalgo text you only get roughly the order of magnitude of your number so often it's unclear which of two close numbers is greater. Also the zalgo text is annoying. As a joke notation, this is great because of the zalgo text, which was cleverly designed to seem more meaningful and understandable than it is. (5, 10)/10

Hex: Can't add or multiply numbers easily, converting to scientific is a mental workout, precision is sometimes terrible and sometimes great, the first letter is basically a waste of space due to almost always being F. In its defense, it's extremely easy to compare numbers (that is, determine which is bigger), it always takes up the same amount of space, it has a completely different basic idea than all the other notations, and this basic idea is natural enough that I wouldn't be surprised if someone else had thought of it first. These points of defense basically don't help it as a serious notation, though. As a joke notation, great because it looks sort of approachable and it's apparently hard to determine what it does even in a loose sense and after reading the code (yes, I'm biased). (3, 10)/10

Imperial: I sort of understand how this works, but not really. Probably if I memorized a bunch of stuff (including the size of archaic imperial units) I could start to do arithmetic operations and convert to scientific, but I'm not that confident (note that before a trillion, though, it's easy to deal with). Unwieldy in length (probably the longest current notation). For all these reasons, a good joke notation, though it's worth saying that it fails for extremely large numbers within break infinity's limit (at about e7e11) and hasn't been fixed yet. (3, 9)/10

Clock: Makes sense but you have to read the code. Basically base-12 scientific but with edge cases. The theoretical highest representable number is basically just after break infinity's limit. The precision isn't great, except when you consider that the notation always uses between 1 and 4 clocks each of which has 12 possibilities (ignoring infinity), in which case the precision is great. Addition and multiplication by small numbers aren't too bad, multiplication of two large numbers is harder. It's hard but possible to roughly convert to scientific. A good joke notation because it barely looks like a notation at all. (6, 9)/10

Prime: Doing arithmetic operations or conversion is basically impossible for high enough numbers, where "high enough" is beyond a trillion or so. The precision is OK. Basically what it seems like (factorization), except with rounding. Good joke notation because it's a novel way of writing numbers. (3, 8)/10

Bar: Base-8 brackets with different characters, without the e or period, and in reverse order. Roughly the same ease of use as brackets. As a joke notation, slightly more disguised. (6, 7)/10

Shi: Fairly bad precision, impossible to do arithmetic or conversion. OK joke notation because shi shi shi shi. (2, 6)/10

Blind: (0, 10)/10
