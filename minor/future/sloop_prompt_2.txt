Can you solve this 6x6 Simple Loop puzzle? The rules of Simple Loop are that you have to visit every unshaded cell in a single loop, only passing between pairs of cells sharing an edge, not visiting any shaded cells, and not visiting any cells more than once. Some tips:
1: If an unshaded cell can only have two possible exits to adjacent cells (e.g., if it's a corner), both must be used.
2: If an unshaded cell is known to already have two used exits (e.g., if it's next to two corners), it can't have any other exits.
3: If drawing an edge would close off part of the loop from the rest, that edge can't be used.

This is the Simple Loop puzzle, presented in a 6x6 character grid format, with . being an unshaded cell and # being a shaded cell. There are six shaded cells, at zero-indexed coordinates (first row, then column) (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 1), and (5, 5).

I have the following code for this, but the code goes into an infinite loop. Fixing the infinite loop may be one way to solve the puzzle.
```py
import numpy as np

# Define the 6x6 grid, where 0 = unshaded cell (.), 1 = shaded cell (#)
grid = np.array([
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
])

# Initialize the solution grid to track loop connections (edges)
# 0 = no connection, 1 = horizontal connection, 2 = vertical connection
solution = np.zeros((6, 6, 4))  # [row, col, {left, up, right, down}]

# Function to check if a cell is within bounds
def in_bounds(row, col):
    return 0 <= row < 6 and 0 <= col < 6

# Function to implement logical rules to solve the puzzle
def solve_simple_loop(grid, solution):
    # Iterate until all constraints are satisfied
    progress = True
    while progress:
        progress = False
        for r in range(6):
            for c in range(6):
                if grid[r, c] == 1:  # Skip shaded cells
                    continue

                # Count current connections for this cell
                connections = [
                    solution[r, c, 0] if in_bounds(r, c - 1) else 0,  # left
                    solution[r, c, 1] if in_bounds(r - 1, c) else 0,  # up
                    solution[r, c, 2] if in_bounds(r, c + 1) else 0,  # right
                    solution[r, c, 3] if in_bounds(r + 1, c) else 0,  # down
                ]
                count = sum(connections)

                # Apply rule: If a cell has exactly 2 connections, block all others
                if count == 2:
                    for d in range(4):
                        if connections[d] == 0:

                            progress = True

                # Apply rule: If a cell can only have 2 connections, add them
