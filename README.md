# misc
A repository of random stuff, created by dan-simon. (Readme last updated September 24, 2024.)
## Incremental games
- The "fe000000" directory has a game I made called FE000000 which is complete and has been getting bugfixes and QoL improvements for several years. It's probably the best/longest game here (roughly a week of active play, though as an incremental a lot of that is waiting).
- The "5hours" directory has a game I made called "5 hours until the update" which was made somewhat earlier and is less polished. It's also shorter.
- The "b2" directory has a game I made called "Infinite Layers" (worse naming scheme) which has a relatively minimalist balancing design. It's somewhat less polished than the two above.
- The "smirt" and "trims" directories are not-very-worked on Trimps-like game prototypes, which may have bugs. I'm mostly keeping them in the main directory to have some game prototype examples there.
#### Notations
Notations are ways of representing numbers in incremental games.
- The "what-the-hex" directory has a guide to the specific notation of Hex notation.
- The "notation-information" directory has generally less detailed information on some other notations.
- The "hex-clock" and "hex-clock-2" directories have online clocks using Hex notation (the second having more QoL options).
- The "iroha" directory has an implementation of a notation called Iroha notation.
#### Other incremental-related
- The "saves" directory contains some FE000000 saves.
- The "big-number" directory contains a very simple and potentially buggy JS file to represent numbers over the JS number limit.
## Other games
- The "go-but-not" directory has an implementation of a go-like game, together with a bot that (very badly) plays it.
- The "reduction" and "reduction-2-player" directories have (solitare/two-player) implementations of a game of clearing a board of all stones on it.
## Simple Loop
I did some not-very-organized investigation into the math of Simple Loop.
- The many directories with "sloop" or "simple_loop" in their name are various products of that research (solving interfaces, some information, a game where you solve simple loops).
## Other puzzles
Most of my puzzle stuff can be found in my "puzzles" repository, not here.
- The "dynastyword" directory has an implementation of a logic puzzle genre that is usually in Japanese, but can work without Japanese knowledge if you relax some word constraints.
- The "is-it-gph-yet" and "is-it-reddot-yet" directories have small untested hunts I made before those hunts, along with countdown times both of which are long zero (those hunts themselves were not written by me).
## Other
- The "probability" directory has some code that can do probability calculations with very small chances.
- The "status" directory has a sometimes-updated file with my current status.
- The "minor" directory has miscellaneous stuff of all these types that I wanted to store away for one reason or another (mostly just being lower-quality).
